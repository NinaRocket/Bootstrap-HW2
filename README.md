# Bootstrap-HW2


What is this?
This is a website that uses responsive bootstrap code. This website
is a portfolio for Nina Rocket. This website should be viewable on multiple devices and in different browsers. The following is a list of steps taken to create the website, followed by screenshots of what it should like. 

1. Created repository and files: index, contact, portfolio html files as well as a CSS file.

2. Linked bootstrap css in header and js in bottom of body.

3. Added navbar.

4. Tested that navbar has collapsable icon when shrinking to mobile size, it works and committed/pushed to github. 

5. Added card layout to index as well, pushed to github. 

6. Put a basic form in contact.html.

7. Finally got my .active in my navigation bar to behave. Push to github.

8. Added a personal photo to index.html

9. Added google fonts.

10. Included a bootstrap footer.

11. Added rows and columns on the portfolio page for future portfolio items.
